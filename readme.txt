Project 4: Diffuse Raytracing

Submission is designed to be run on the computers at
UCSB's CSIL tech lab. Makefile and includes are for a
Linux Fedora distribution, with GLU and GLUT installed.

This my initial raytracer project. Features include:
- Fixed camera, perspective view.
- Sphere objects.
- Diffuse shading, using the Blinn-Phong model.
- Shadows and specular highlights.
